## Citation

This game was initially created by [Wordle - A daily word game](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/)

All creative rights belong to its developer.

## Why did I re-create this?

- I like the original.

- I didn't like only playing this once a day, so this one refreshes hourly.

- I can submit my own list of words.

- I was bored waiting for an appointment, so I coded this on my phone (The main reason).
- Liam - because I saw it on my github, probably should be doing other stuff

## Disclaimer

PEP8 was a thought because i don't like yellow lines (pycharm).

Enjoy!
